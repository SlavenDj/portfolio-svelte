				Hello! I'm Slaven, a passionate full-stack developer specializing in frontend development
				and UI/UX design. My journey began in primary-500 school, where my curiosity and fascination
				with technology ignited. From an early age, I was captivated by the power of coding and
				design to transform ideas into immersive digital experiences. Throughout my educational
				journey, I proactively delved deeper into programming and design concepts, teaching myself
				the fundamentals and expanding my skills through personal projects and online resources.
				Now, as a professional, I possess expertise in frontend and backend development, as well as
				UI/UX design. With a well-rounded skill set and an unwavering thirst for knowledge, I
